# Game-R_P_S_L_S
This is my very first project that I have done pure on my own.
I used such tools/technologies as HTML5, CSS, vanilla.js ;)
In this case I used Sass combained with Gulp. It gave me an oportunity to work with a few scss files to make minimized CSS files.
I have chosen Sass because it has more readable form.
Application is writen according to RWD, so it can be run as a mobile.

It shows my level of experience I have achived since I had started learning in January 2020.
